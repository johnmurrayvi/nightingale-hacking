If you don't want to build Nightingale yourself, you can download
prebuilt binaries form http://getnightingale.com.

========================================================================
1. Prepare Build Envoironment:
========================================================================
Make sure you have all dependencies to build Nightingale installed and
added the wished configuration options. For further information, please
check out the README.

========================================================================
2. Build and Install Nightingale:
========================================================================

Type the following commands into any console with the context of the
source folder:

    $ ./build.sh
    $ sudo make install

If you are on Windows or Mac OS X, the `sudo make install` command will
not work. You will find an installed in the compiled/dist folder.

========================================================================
A. On Updating
========================================================================

By installing Nightingale to your system, Nightingale can no longer
update itself. This is most likely desired, as updates would replace
self-built binaries with pre-built binaries. You will still receive a
notification if an update is available, but applying it will fail.

In order to update your Nightingale installation, you will have to
redownload the source code of Nightingale, build and install it again.

If you want automatic updates, specify a `DESTDIR` inside your home.
Example:
    $ make DESTDIR=~/ install

Depending on your PATH, this might make the nightingale binary
available from the command line (some .profile files check if $HOME/bin
exists and add it to the path if it does). This won't install the icon
in your system's application menu for sure.

Alternatively you can alter `libdir` to a location inside your
home directory with something along the lines of
    $ make libdir=/home/user/ngale install

Now only what normally would be installed to /usr/lib will be
installed to you home folder. And the nightingale binary is
symlinked to that lib folder from /usr/bin and the icon will be
installed in your application menu.

If you use sudo to install Nightingale to your home directory updates will
still not work.
